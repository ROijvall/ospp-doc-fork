_Prio_

Fix relative paths to resources - done? needs testing

Make sure you can input multiple commands at once, looks like only one thing at a time is working currently - now works, testing would be good. strategy for now seems sufficient

Fix barrel so that it is relative to the tank instead of the map - done, easy fix

Add some kind of death mechanic - done, can be improved

Make random maps have slightly steep slopes, maybe make random maps an option and have some premade ones available - maps now more slopelike, maybe it would be nice to have both options

Try to smooth movement along ground, both up and downhill. Make sure acceleration isn't too crazy

Make a menu for leaving games/give players the option to restart every round.

    If solo player simply restart. If 2+ players are connected restart when only one is remaining. If a player quits then they return to start screen

Make tank graphic less jittery when climbing/descending slopes

_Future_

Add a slightly random wind element to projectiles 

Add screen indicator for cooldowns and wind

Future power-ups?

Either make the screen slightly larger or make tanks slightly smaller to better facilitate 4 or more players

Write some tests for back-end and investigate how many requests the server can handle (ie is the server able to process 1 request every tick from 4 players, are any sends lost etc)

Try to improve performance in general!
